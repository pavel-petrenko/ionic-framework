### BREAKING CHANGES

* **all:** The `RadioChangeEventDetail` interface has been removed in favor of `RadioGroupChangeEventDetail`.
* **datetime:** The `ion-datetime` component has been revamped to use a new calendar style. As a result, some APIs have been removed. See https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/master/BREAKING.md for more details.
* **popover:** Converted `ion-popover` to use the Shadow DOM.
* **vue:** - Dropped support for prefixed overlay events in favor of non prefixed events (I.e. `@onDidDismiss` becomes `@didDismiss`).
- Minimum required version of Vue is now Vue v3.0.6 or newer.
* **vue:** Support for child routes nested inside of tabs has been removed to better conform to Vue Router's best practices. Additional routes should be written as sibling routes with the parent tab as the path prefix.
